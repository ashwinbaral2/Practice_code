# Topic: CLASSES & INHERITANCE (Harder)
# Level: Thinking in OOP
# Instructions:
# - Use inheritance, super(), and method overriding
# - Practice creating parent and child classes
# ==============================


# Q1.
# Create a parent class called Animal with a method:
# - sound() that prints "Some sound"
# Create a child class Dog that inherits Animal
# and overrides sound() to print "Bark"


# Q2.
# Create a parent class Vehicle with attributes:
# - brand
# - model
# Add a method to display details
# Create a child class Car that inherits Vehicle
# and adds an attribute 'year'


# Q3.
# Create a parent class Employee with attributes:
# - name
# - salary
# Add a method display()
# Create a child class Manager that inherits Employee
# and overrides display() to include "Manager: " before name


# Q4.
# Create a multi-level inheritance structure:
# - Grandparent class: Person (name)
# - Parent class: Employee (salary)
# - Child class: Developer (language)
# Each class should have a method to display its own info


# Q5.
# Use isinstance() and issubclass() to check:
# - if a Developer object is an instance of Employee and Person
# - if Developer class is a subclass of Employee and Person
