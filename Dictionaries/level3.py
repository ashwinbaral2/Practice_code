# Topic: DICTIONARIES (Harder Logic)
# Level: Real-world thinking
# Instructions:
# - Use loops and conditionals
# - Do NOT use Counter or other shortcuts
# ==============================


# Q1.
# Write a program that takes a list of numbers
# and creates a dictionary where:
# - keys = numbers
# - values = how many times each number appears in the list


# Q2.
# Write a program that merges two dictionaries.
# If the same key exists in both, sum their values.


# Q3.
# Write a program that inverts a dictionary
# with non-unique values by making the value
# point to a list of corresponding keys.
# Example:
# Input: {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 1}
# Output: {1: ['a', 'c'], 2: ['b']}


# Q4.
# Write a program that finds all keys in a dictionary
# that have values above the average of all values.


# Q5.
# Write a program that takes a dictionary
# and returns a list of tuples sorted by value in descending order.
# Do NOT use the sorted() function.
