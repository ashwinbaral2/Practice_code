# - Do NOT use set(), sort(), or collections helpers
# ==============================


# Q1.
# Write a program that takes a list of numbers
# and creates a new list containing only
# the elements that appear MORE THAN ONCE.


# Q2.
# Write a program that takes a list of integers
# and separates them into two lists:
# - one containing positive numbers
# - one containing negative numbers
# Zero should be ignored.


# Q3.
# Write a program that finds the SECOND LARGEST
# number in a list.
# Do NOT use sort() or max().


# Q4.
# Write a program that rotates a list to the left by one position.
# Example:
# Input:  [1, 2, 3, 4]
# Output: [2, 3, 4, 1]


# Q5.
# Write a program that checks whether a list
# is a palindrome (reads the same forward and backward)
# WITHOUT reversing the list.
