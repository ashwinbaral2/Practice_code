# Topic: LOGIC + LOOPS + FUNCTIONS (Harder)
# Level: Advanced Beginner / Intermediate
# Instructions:
# - Combine boolean logic with loops and functions
# - Avoid using built-in shortcuts
# ==============================


# Q1.
# Write a function that takes a list of integers
# and returns True if all numbers are even, else False.
# Use a loop and logical operators.


# Q2.
# Write a function that takes a string and returns True
# if the string contains at least one vowel AND
# at least one uppercase letter.


# Q3.
# Write a function that simulates a simple AND gate
# over two lists of booleans of equal length.
# Return a new list where each element is the AND
# of the corresponding elements from the two input lists.


# Q4.
# Write a function that takes a list of passwords
# and returns a new list containing only those passwords
# that meet ALL of the following criteria:
# - length >= 8
# - contains at least one uppercase letter
# - contains at least one digit
# - contains at least one special character (!, @, #, $, %, &, *)


# Q5.
# Write a function that takes a list of integers
# and returns True if the sum of all numbers divisible by 3
# is greater than the sum of all numbers divisible by 5.
